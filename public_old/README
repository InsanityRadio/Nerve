Nerve is Insanity Radio's new ingest system

What does that mean? Well, it's basically a web-app that lets you upload songs to Myriad Playout. It reduces the risk that something rude will get uploaded, by checking every uploaded file. And if it's a radio edit, then songs can be manually approved/rejected.

Nerve is pretty straightforward to configure - you just need to install the right Ruby Gems (bundler, sinatra, mysql2)

Nerve has the following dependencies:

- A MySQL server
- MySQL client (mysql-devel on RHEL, mysql-dev on Debian)
- Redis Server (redis on both RHEL/Debian, easy to configure, defaults work)
- sox (available in rpmforge on RHEL, sox and libsox-fmt-mp3 on Debian)
- lame, flac, ogg, etc. libraries
- audiowaveform (https://github.com/bbcrd/audiowaveform, really easy to build)
