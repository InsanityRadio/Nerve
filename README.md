# Nerve

Nerve is a music library and importation system, inspired by it's predecessor, IRIS. Written in Ruby, Nerve has a modern and intuitive interface, and is built using modern technologies.

Nerve is object-oriented and (nearly) event-ready, and is completely customisable and extendable. We mean "object oriented" in the broadcast sense - you can tie its data into systems to create immersive and future-proofed content through in-development APIs. 


## Features

* EBU-R128 loudness scanning and configurable compression, depending on station sound goals. 
* Open source, and extendable. Although it's built for Myriad, it should be easy to write a handler for other playout systems
* Looks nice, and easy to use. 
* **Nearly full Myriad (Audio Wall and AutoTrack) integration** - as far as we're aware, that's a first. As in, nobody's ever fully integrated with both. This means there's no extra peak normalisation that may make tracks quiet. 
* *Bitrate estimation* for MP3 files that have been "up-scaled". Prevents phony '320'kbps files making it anywhere near your playout system
* Upload approval - if a song could be offensive or cause issues, it will be sidelined for approval by an editor. Otherwise, allow presenters/producers to work independently to save time/resources. 
* Account integration - if you can code it, you can practically integrate it with any SSO system.
* Lyric detection and scanning (access modules are provided, but it's up to you to work out licensing/legal terms)
* *Fail-safe* mode of operation - uploads will have to manually be approved
* Duplicate checking - not fully accurate but definitely comes in handy. 


###*Planned Feature Queue*

* *Ability to import show-specific/private content (e.g. interviews, vox-pops, etc. ), which are also normalised. *
* *Fully searchable music library with "suggest replacement" options*
* *Documented JSON API for developers and integration*
* *Multiple node support*
* *Storage of original pre-processed tracks to allow multiple station profiles*
* *Song suggestion based on Spotify APIs*
* *Simultaneous playout system*


## Installation

I haven't had time to write an installation guide, but it's not really that straightforward, unfortunately. Some statically linked binaries are currently included in the source tree to make it easier to run some components. 

Nerve is based on Sinatra, a microframework for Ruby. We chose this over Rails as we didn't feel ActiveRecord would suit this project at its current level (Full-text search is hard to implement on some DBMS, and MySQL is fine). 

You will need to install a Redis server (the default settings work fine), and you'll need a MySQL database. 

Run a simple `bundle install` to get (hopefully) all of the dependencies. 

You'll need to create a rather large space for the "export" directory. I'll admit, this needs a re-name, as it doesn't describe its functionality very accurately. 

You'll also need to mount your playout drives on the "master" node

## Quick Tasks / To-do

- Create recall button on interface that invokes Nerve::Job::Recall
- Make the Library tab work. 
- Create fulltext search for Library.
- Song Versions
	- Text field on interface, perhaps with pre-set versions
	- Automatically detect "Remix" in titles of uploads
